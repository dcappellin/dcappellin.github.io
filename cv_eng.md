## Professional Experience

### ASEM S.r.l. (A Rockwell Automation company), Verona, Italy • 2015 - Present

#### Software Operations Manager

I am tenacious, resilient, and determined to pursue my goals despite any challenges that may arise. Now I lead the "assembly line" of ASEM's software products with a focus on Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) and Quality Assurance (QA) processes. My ability to build strong interpersonal relationships has played a crucial role in achieving this. I am aware that still have much to learn about interpersonal dynamics, and I am wholeheartedly dedicating my efforts to improve relationships within the team. I firmly believe that the true strength of a team lies in the quality of the connections among its members. My commitment to this goal will undoubtedly serve as a valuable asset for both the future professional development of the company and myself.

#### Quality Assurance Lead

In the Italian context, finding experienced Quality Assurance (QA) professionals proves to challenging, mainly due to the lack of a widespread software testing culture. Nonetheless, when I was offered the opportunity to establish and lead a QA team, I embrace this challenge with unwavering determination, even in the face of apparent obstacles. As a leader, I recognized that effective communication and empathy are vital in cultivating a motivated and cohesive team. Consequently I prioritized understanding my team members and establishing clear lines of effective communication. I understand that, for a successful QA engineer, in addition to technical expertise, the ability to articulate software nonconformities to developers accurately and concise is of utmost importance.

#### Senior Software Engineer

I was seamlessly integrated into a cutting-edge web project, leveraging skills from my previous professional experience. However, upon starting, I was assigned to an entire different project, demanding the use of programming languages unfamiliar to me. Undeterred by the challenge, I embraced it with determination, recognizing the significance of adapting to change for personal and professional growth. I also came to understand the delicate balance between striving for excellence and making necessary compromises, all while delivering the utmost value. Engaging in this project allowed me to build strong relationships with my new team colleagues, laying a robust groundwork for my ongoing professional development within the company.

### Exor International S.p.A., San Giovanni Lupatoto VR, Italy • 2005 - 2015

#### Senior Software Engineer

On September 29, after a stimulating hour and a half interview, the CEO’s enthusiasm for my professional journey led to an immediate job offer, and I began as a permanent employee the next day, which happened to be a Friday. The imaginative and visionary CEO engaged me in the design, development, and management of an ambitious Enterprise 2.0 project that aimed to integrate blogs and wiki into a unified tool, enhancing the exchange and retrieval of business information. Over the course of five challenging years, I delved the intricacies of software life cycles, adopting agile methodologies. Above all, I embraced the concept of change, recognizing it as a driving force rather than an obstacle. I cultivated patience and a commitment to seeking the best solution, even if it meant anew at times. I came to know that sometimes you win, often you learn. In September 2010, I transitioned to the R&D department, where I further honed my web development skills and took on the exciting challenge of software development for embedded devices. From June 2012 to March 2013 I assumed the responsibility of managing customer training and manuals for the JMobile product, Exor International's website fleet, and its entire online presence across social networks. Throughout these experiences, I came to appreciate the complexities and reward of collaborating with multicultural development teams.

### Freelancer, Verona, Italy • 2000 - 2015

I had made up my mind to pursue a university education while also needing to support myself financially with a job that allowed me to attend classes and prepare for exams. Luckily, I was offered VAT-registered collaborations and IT consulting across various domains, including software solution development and training courses. As a freelancer, this opportunity enabled me not only to  fully finance my university studies but also provided extra income. While I found the work fulfilling, it was essential for me to see through the project I had started. Therefore, I decided to suspend my freelance activity and focus on completing my university studies. Shortly after graduating, in 2005, I was thrilled to be offered my first position as an employee, which I eagerly accepted. After five years of experience as a self-employed individual, I came to realize that my preference lay in dedicating all my resources to the project implementation rather than engaging in the constant pursuit of new clients, as is customary for consultants. Consequently, I kept my VAT number for an additional ten years, continuing to cater to my existing clients and occasionally taking on new projects through word-of-mouth referrals.

### Gruppo 2F, Verona, Italy • 1997 - 2002

#### Web developer

The process of developing a website encompasses not only technical expertise but also establishing a strong rapport with the client to comprehend their specific requirements and expectations, which then need to be translated into a product that reflect their vision. My background in teaching has undoubtedly aided my communication skills, but effectively engaging with clients is a distinct skill that requires continuous learning. Initially it was challenging, andI was  fortunate to have the support of the sales department. However, as I grasped the process, things became more manageable. Upon assuming the role of technical manager for the Verona office, I relished considerable degree of independence in handling customer relationships.

#### Insegnante

Being inherently shy and introverted, my initial work experience proved to be a valuable opportunity for personal growth in social interactions. Frequently, I conducted  introductory computer courses in remote areas within the province of Verona during evening hours, catering to diverse audiences with varying educational background. Through these experiences, I humbly acquired the skill of articulating complex concepts in a language easily understandable to my students, earning recognition at the regional level as the top teacher.
