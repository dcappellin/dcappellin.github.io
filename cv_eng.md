## Experience

#### ASEM S.r.l. (A Rockwell Automation company)

##### 2015 - Ongoing •  Verona, Italy

#### Software Operations Manager

I am tenacious, resilient, and determined in pursuing my objectives, regardless of the challenges that may arise. Presently, I am at the helm of the software product "assembly line" at ASEM, with a particular focus on Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) and Quality Assurance (QA) processes. My ability to foster strong interpersonal relationships has been pivotal in achieving this outcome. I am aware that I still have much to learn regarding relational dynamics, and I am channeling all my efforts into enhancing the internal relationships within the group, as I recognize that a team's value lies precisely in the quality of relationships formed among its members. I am confident that my dedication to this goal will serve as a valuable asset for the company's future professional development and my own.

#### Quality Assurance Lead

In the Italian context, the search for proficient individuals within the Quality Assurance sector presents itself as a challenge, primarily due to the absence of a widespread software testing culture. Nonetheless, when presented with the opportunity to establish and lead a QA team, I approached this challenge with determination, despite its apparent insurmountability. As a leader, I have come to understand that communication and empathy are the cornerstone for cultivating a motivated and cohesive team. I structured the group's work by emphasizing the significance of comprehending individuals and establishing effective communication. For a capable QA engineer, in addition to technical competencies, the ability to articulate software non-conformities clearly and precisely to developers is paramount.

#### Senior Software Engineer

I was seamlessly integrated into a cutting-edge web project, leveraging skills from my previous professional experience. However, right from the first day, I was assigned to an entire different project, requiring the use of programming languages I had not previously encountered. I embraced this challenge without becoming discouraged and grasped the significance of adapting to changes as an integral part of professional advancement. I also came to realize that the pursuit of excellence can be balanced with the necessity of making compromises, all while aiming to deliver utmost added value. This project presented a valuable opportunity to establish relationships with my new team colleagues, laying a strong foundation for my professional growth within the company.

#### Exor International S.p.A.

##### 2005 - 2015 • San Giovanni Lupatoto VR, Italy

#### Senior Software Engineer

On September 29, 2005, after an hour and a half of interview, the CEO was so enthusiastic about my work history that he asked me to start the next day, making my first day of work as a permanent employee a Friday. The visionary CEO involved me in the design, development, and management of an Enterprise 2.0 project aiming to integrate blogs and wikis into a single tool, enhancing the exchange and retrieval of corporate information. These were five challenging years during which I acquired an understanding of the software product lifecycle stages using agile methodologies. Above all, I embraced the concept of change, seeing it as something to be embraced rather than hindered. I learned to patiently seek the best solution, even if it sometimes meant starting over. I realized that sometimes we win, but more often we learn. Since September 2010, I have been reassigned to the Research and Development department where, in addition to further strengthening my skills in the web domain, I had the opportunity to engage with software development for embedded devices. From June 2012 to March 2013, I managed customer training and product documentation for JMobile, the Exor International website portfolio, and its entire web presence across social networks. During these years, I have been exposed to the complexities of collaborating with multicultural development teams.

#### Freelancer Software Engineer

##### 2000 - 2015 • Verona, Italy

I had decided to undertake a graduate program and needed a job that would allow me to take classes and prepare for exams. As freelancer, I provided comprehensive IT consulting services, ranging from software solution development to training courses. As an independent professional, I was able to fully finance my university studies and much more. Even though the work was rewarding, it was important for me to complete the project I had initiated. Thus, I decided to pause my activities and conclude my university journey. Shortly after graduating, in 2005, I was offered my first position as permanent employee, which I eagerly accepted. Following five years of self-employment experience, I had come to realize that I preferred channeling all my resources into projects realization rather than engaging in the constant pursuit of new clients, as is customary for consultants. Ultimately, I retained my self-employed status for another decade, continuing to serve existing clients and taking on a few new projects through word of mouth.

#### Gruppo 2F

##### 1997 - 2002 • Verona, Italy

#### Web developer

The development of a website entails not only technical expertise but also entering into a relationship with the client to understand their needs and expectations, which must then be transformed into a product that reflects their image. My experience in teaching has certainly aided me in communication, but conversing with a client is a distinct skill that requires learning. Initially, it was intricate but once I grasped the process with the support of the sales department, things became more straightforward. After assuming the role of technical lead at the Verona office, I have enjoyed a considerable degree of autonomy in client management.

#### Insegnante

Shy and introverted, this first work experience undoubtedly aided me in developing my interpersonal skills. Frequently, I conducted introductory computer science courses in remote locations within the province of Verona during evening hours, catering to a diverse audience with varying levels of education. With humility, I acquired the ability to articulate complex concepts using language accessible to my students, resulting in regional recognition as best educator.

### Education

#### Laurea in Informatica (M.S. in Computer Science)

##### Università degli Studi di Verona 2005, Verona, Italy

#### Diploma di Ragioniere perito commerciale e programmatore

##### I.T.C.S. Aldo Pasoli, 1994, Verona, Italy
